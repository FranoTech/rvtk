#summary Getting Started

= Details =

The source comes with two libraries. They are librvtk-vc and librvtk-opencv. librvtk-vc is the core library to deal with video capture device(V4l2 API). librvtk-opencv is “supposed” to be an extension to OpenCV for access low level device setting, but only few functions are implemented and the design is not well. It will be completely rewritten afterward. All features that should not be provided by librvtk-vc will be there (e.g. GTK+ Dialog)

librvtk-vc itself is a very simple library that just requires standard library like libc6-dev in order to build, but librvtk-opencv requires packages of gtk+-2.0 and OpenCV.

The package of OpenCV has been available in Debian Etch/SID, they could be installed by:

apt-get install libcv-dev libcvaux-dev libhighgui-dev

The build instructions:

{{{  
  bzr branch http://benlau.e-fever.org/projects/bzr/rvtk rvtk

    cd rvtk

    aclocal
    automake
    autoconf
    ./configure --prefix=/tmp/usr # for testing
    make
    make install

}}}

There are two demo applications available. The first one is a video viewer with two dialogs to choose the input video device and set the properties respectively. The other one is a face detection program from the sample code of OpenCV project.

{{{
    /tmp/usr/bin/v4l2-demo
    /tmp/usr/bin/facedetect
}}}

The library is still under development. The API may change for new version. Therefore, only static link libraries are provided.

Tested Devices :

 *   KWorld DVD Marker [em28xx]
 *  Logitech Quickcam Pro 4000 [PWC] -  The PWC do not support to adjust FPS by standard V4L2 API
 *  Logitech Quickcam Pro for Notebooks[UVC] - The driver supports MJPEG and YUYV for output. If chosen YUYV, only 1024×576 is provided.
 *   Pinnacle DVC 90 [em28xx] - mmap fails in streaming I/O
